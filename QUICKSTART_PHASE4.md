# üöÄ Quick Start: Phase 4 - AI SOAP Note Generation

Get AI-powered SOAP notes running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Phase 3 completed (voice recording & transcription)
- Anthropic API key ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- Node.js 18+ installed

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (30 seconds)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

The `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package is already added to package.json.

## Step 2: Add API Key (1 minute)

Add your Anthropic API key to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Create or edit .env.local
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"' >> .env.local
```

**Get your API key:**
1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Create a new key
5. Copy and paste into `.env.local`

## Step 3: Start the Server (30 seconds)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server starts at http://localhost:3000

## Step 4: Test SOAP Generation (3 minutes)

### Quick Test Flow:

1. **Navigate to New Encounter**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/encounters/new
   ```

2. **Enter Chief Complaint**
   ```
   Example: "Chest pain and shortness of breath"
   ```

3. **Record or Enter Transcript**
   - Option A: Use voice recording (Phase 3)
   - Option B: Manually enter a sample transcript:
   ```
   Patient is a 45-year-old male presenting with chest pain that started 2 hours ago.
   Pain is described as pressure-like, radiating to left arm. Associated with shortness
   of breath and diaphoresis. No relief with rest. Patient has history of hypertension
   and takes lisinopril 10mg daily. Vital signs: BP 150/95, HR 98, RR 20, O2 sat 96%.
   Physical exam reveals anxious appearance, diaphoretic. Cardiovascular exam shows
   regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs clear bilaterally.
   ```

4. **Switch to SOAP Note Tab**
   - Click "SOAP Note" tab at the top

5. **Generate SOAP Note**
   - Click "AI Generate" button
   - Wait 3-5 seconds
   - Review the generated SOAP note

6. **Review Generated Content**
   - Check Subjective section (HPI, ROS)
   - Review Objective findings
   - Verify Assessment and diagnosis
   - Check Plan and medications
   - Review suggested ICD-10 codes

7. **Search for ICD-10 Codes** (Optional)
   - Use the sidebar search
   - Enter symptoms: "chest pain, shortness of breath"
   - Click "Search ICD-10 Codes"
   - Add suggested codes to note

8. **Edit and Save**
   - Click "Edit" to modify any section
   - Make corrections as needed
   - Click "Save" when done

## What You Should See

### SOAP Note Tab
- **Four sections:** SOAP, ICD-10 Codes, Medications, Details
- **AI-generated content** in all SOAP sections
- **ICD-10 codes** with confidence levels
- **Medications** with dosage and frequency
- **Edit/Preview modes** for easy editing

### ICD-10 Search Sidebar
- **Search form** for symptoms/diagnosis
- **AI-suggested codes** with descriptions
- **Confidence indicators** (high/medium/low)
- **Quick add** buttons for codes

## Sample Output

After generating, you should see something like:

```
SUBJECTIVE
Chief Complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath

HPI: 45-year-old male presents with acute onset chest pain that began 
2 hours prior to presentation. Pain is described as pressure-like in 
quality, located in the substernal region with radiation to the left arm...

ROS: Cardiovascular: Positive for chest pain, shortness of breath, 
diaphoresis. Negative for palpitations...

OBJECTIVE
Vital Signs: BP 150/95, HR 98, RR 20, O2 sat 96%
Physical Exam: Patient appears anxious and diaphoretic...

ASSESSMENT
Acute chest pain, concerning for acute coronary syndrome...

PLAN
1. Immediate EKG
2. Cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB)
3. Aspirin 325mg PO now...

ICD-10 CODES
- I20.0 - Unstable angina (high confidence)
- I21.9 - Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified (medium confidence)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to generate SOAP note"
- **Check API key:** Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in `.env.local`
- **Check internet:** API requires connection
- **Check API quota:** Ensure you have credits
- **Check console:** Look for error messages

### "Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/sdk'"
```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk
```

### Slow generation (>10 seconds)
- Normal for long transcripts (500+ words)
- Check internet connection speed
- Anthropic API may be experiencing delays

### Empty SOAP note sections
- Transcript may be too short (need 50+ words)
- Chief complaint is required
- Try with more detailed transcript

### ICD-10 search not working
- Enter at least one symptom
- Check API key is valid
- Verify internet connection

## Next Steps

### Explore Features
1. **Edit SOAP sections** - Click edit mode
2. **Add medications** - Use medication tab
3. **Search ICD-10 codes** - Try different symptoms
4. **Copy note** - Use copy button for export
5. **Save encounter** - Complete documentation

### Customize
1. **Patient context** - Add age, gender, allergies
2. **Medical history** - Include past conditions
3. **Current medications** - List active meds
4. **Refine prompts** - Adjust in `lib/claude.ts`

### Test Scenarios

## Cost Monitoring

### Typical Costs
- **Short note** (100 words): $0.03-$0.05
- **Medium note** (300 words): $0.05-$0.08
- **Long note** (500 words): $0.08-$0.12

### Monthly Estimates

Very affordable for the time saved!

## API Key Security

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Store in `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- Use environment variables
- Keep key private
- Rotate keys periodically

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Hardcode in source files
- Commit to version control
- Share publicly
- Use in client-side code

## Support

### Documentation
- **PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md** - Full documentation
- **README.md** - Project overview
- **API docs** - In code comments

### Common Issues
- Check console for errors
- Verify all environment variables
- Ensure dependencies installed
- Review API key permissions

## Success!

If you can:
- ‚úÖ Generate a SOAP note from a transcript
- ‚úÖ See structured S.O.A.P. sections
- ‚úÖ Get ICD-10 code suggestions
- ‚úÖ Edit and save the note
